# Note
Unfortunately my decision to use my initials backfired, they are no longer my initials. I have planned to move on from this engine and create a new one using the knowledge I have learned. I will aim to make this new engine in C++ to avoid too much time solving too many low level issues but still focus lightweight and prioritize development speed.
