PHASE 1: (COOK)
-Input:
A series of directorories containing package configuration files and resources

-Run file processors on data in the files if out of date (relative to last cache run)
-If the state is unpackaged: output to a mirror of that path in the build resource directory
-If the state is packaged: output to a mirror of that path in the build resource directory inside a _ASPAK_CACHE_ 
and an PAKNAME.ASRC_PAKCFG file with the "packageOut" value as name with '/' turned into '@'
-If the file is overridden write a ORIGINALNAME.EXTENSION.ASRC_OVERRIDE with the file names '/' turned into '@'
 
PHASE 2: (MANIFEST)
Dive through the folders of the asset folders

Collect each file name
Check if there is an ASRC_OVERRIDE version of the file: open that set contents as the overridden name, else use "_PATH_"
Then delete the ASRC_OVERRIDE file

If the folder is NOT an _ASPAK_CACHE_: reserve in to write in the "files" section
If the folder is an _ASPAK_CACHE_: reserve in to write in the "aspak" section

PHASE 3: (PACK)
Future

-Output:
A series of processed resource files in the project directory (with potential for zipping)
